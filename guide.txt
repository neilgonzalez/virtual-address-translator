1. virtual memory is provided by addresses.txt
2. virtual memory is split up into two parts
   (Page# and offset)
3. try and see if the PAGE # results in a TLB hit
4. if it does, then no memory access is required
   	  construct the new phisical address using
	  the original offset as well as the PPN
	  (physical page number) in the TLB

5. if there is a TLB Miss, check the PTEs and look for the page number there.
6. If theres a match use the original offset as well as the page number found in the PTE.

7. If both tables miss, we hae a page fault, so read a 256 byte page from backing_store.bin and update the page table
